            <h2>External Links</h2>
            <p>Since 2012, Twitter's API (an interface for external applications like ours) requires user authentication and limits the amount of requests per application and minute. To request the API more frequently, we need Access Tokens that are generated upon login. Every user, who logs in through our website generates a token. We need approximately 600 of them to collect the German data and multiple thousands to scale up to Twitter's entire network. That's why your help is decisive!</p>
